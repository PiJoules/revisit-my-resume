# Five programming problems every Software Engineer should be able to solve in less than 1 hour

It took me 1 hr 15 min :(

```
"Here is the deal: if you can't solve the following 5 problems in less than 1 hour, you may want to revisit your resume. You might be great at doing whatever you do today, but you need to stop calling yourself a "Software Engineer" (or Programmer, or Computer Science specialist, or even maybe "Developer".) Stop lying to yourself, and take some time to re-focus your priorities."
